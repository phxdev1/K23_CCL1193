# Guidebook Template

## Goal

This lab will demonstrate how to utilize Flow Designer for sending email notifications. A variety of methods for sending these notifications will be discussed, including:

1. Sending an email through Flow Designer
2. HTML formatted emailing
3. Template based emails.

# Exercise 1 - Using Flow Designer to Send Email

## Goal
In this exercise, we're going to send a plain text email to Gallagher Grey, alerting him that a new hiking party has been created.

## Creating a New Workflow
Open the application up in App Engine Studio
<!-- Walk the attendees through creating a new Workflow that is triggered on insert of a hiking new hiking party. -->

Extra Credit: Add a variable to this email that prints out the name of the hiking party.


# Exercise 2 - HTML formatted Emails

## Goal
In this exercise, we'll be triggering a nicely formatted, HTML email to be sent to the Park Rangers whenever a Hobble-A-Ton group has missed their check in.

<!-- Walk the attendees through creating a new workflow that is triggered when a party misses a check-in (time based seems complicated, double check in office hours) -->

Provide some HTML snippets that allow the attendees to copy and paste an html formatted email

# Exercise 3 - Using templates to send emails

## Goal
In this lab, we'll learn how to convert our email into a template  so our notifications can easily be reconfigured when we share our app with the West Eros National Park.
